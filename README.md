# Prediction-of-Product-Sales

## Project Overview

- The overarching goal of this project is to accurately predict product sales and ultimately increase revenue for a potential stakeholder.
-  The first step was to clean the dirty data set.
-  Next I had to visualize and display all relevant information about each feature.
-  I then had to clean the data for the purposes of implementing machine learning.
-  Using and optimizing various regression models to make product sales with the lowest error.

- This histogram shows that there are over 1,500 items that generate less than $500 in sales.
- We can potentially take a closer look into these items to see why that may be the case.

- Knowing how well seafood performs overall, we might want to look into upping the seafood inventory at certain locations.
- I would also reccommend upping the Starchy food inventory due to it's consistentcy.
- The top three item groups are all performing very well.

- Visualizing the correlation found between "Item_MRP" and "Item_Outlet_Sales" appears to show that the higher the price of an item the higher the item's potential sales.
- We might be able to leverage this by adding more high quality, high price items to our stock.
